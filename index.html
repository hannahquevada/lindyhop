      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Lindy Hop is a partnered dance that originated from 1920s Harlem, USA. It involves a leader and follower dancing to jazz or swing music (like the song playing right now!). The dance itself broke barriers between black and white communities and has strong ties to African American social dancing culture.</h5>

      <h5>Lindy Hop is named after Charles Lindbergh, an aviator who made a groundbreaking flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. To commemorate his accomplishment, many songs, business and recipes etc. were named after him, including Lindy Hop.

      <h1>Lindy Hop Back Then</h1>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Lindy Hop was first danced in 1928 at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, New York. <strong><em>Shorty ‘George’ Snowden</em></strong> is credited with inventing and naming the dance during a long dance marathon held in the ballroom. As one of the few ballrooms that allowed the White and Black communities to dance together, people from both communities were able to share dance moves and inspire each other. Thus, Lindy Hop became more refined and flourished.</h5>

<p class="w3-text-grey">Lindy Hop was a popular dance throughout the late 1920s to 1940s.</p>

<h5 class="w3-padding-32"><strong><em>Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers</strong></em> was the first dance troupe to popularise Lindy Hop. Its members were some of the best dancers from the Savoy ballroom. The talented troupe performed in several countries and movies. One of their most well-known performances can be found in the video below.</h5>
